               tool. MOVIS allows you to explore multiple time-series omics

                Currently, MOVIS supports *genomics*, *proteomics*,
                *metabolomics*, *transcriptomics*, and *physico-chemical*
                data sets.

                You can see the examples of what kind of data sets MOVIS
                supports on *Example 1* and *Example 2* pages on the left.
                Example 1 consists of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and
                physico-chemical data. Example 2 contains only transcriptomics
                data.

                ### Data set formats

                MOVIS supports various data set formats for each omic and we
                are constantly working on expanding the support to even more
                formats in the future. Current support is shown below:
