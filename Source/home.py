                Currently, MOVIS supports *genomics*, *proteomics*,
                *metabolomics*, *transcriptomics*, and *physico-chemical*
                time-series data sets.

                You can see the examples of what kind of data sets MOVIS
                supports on *Example 1* and *Example 2* pages on the sidebar.
                Example 1 consists of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and
                physico-chemical time-series data. Example 2 contains only
                transcriptomics time-series data.
